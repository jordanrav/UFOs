# UFOs
## Overview of the project
the point of this project is to create a website that contains multiple accounts of UFO sightings for people to look through

## Results
to use this webpage, you must enter information in the Filter Search section to acquire UFO sightings that fit the user's criteria. Users can use five filters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. An example of how to use the filter section is provided below; in the image, I had put it to only show UFO sightings in cities called Benton.

## Summary

### Potential Drawback
a potential drawback of this project is not having the capability of adding more UFO sightings to the list so that there is more data that users can see.

### Potential Additions

There are a couple of additions that would be beneficial for the website. One possible addition would be adding a drop list for the filter section to make filtering easier for the users. Another addition that could be added which I had mentioned in the potential drawback, is adding the ability to input newer UFO sightings.
